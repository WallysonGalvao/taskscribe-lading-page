      "pricing": {
        "q": "How much does TaskScribe cost?",
        "a": "We have a free plan with 5 free transcriptions per month. The Pro plan costs $19/month (or $190/year with 17% discount) and offers unlimited transcriptions + AI features for task extraction."

        "q": "What is speaker identification (Speaker Diarization)?",

      "gpu": {
        "q": "Do I need a GPU to use it?",
