# TaskScribe - Complete Documentation for LLMs
# This is the extended version of llms.txt with comprehensive information

## Product Overview

**TaskScribe** is a desktop application designed for professionals who need to transcribe audio and video content while maintaining complete data privacy. Unlike cloud-based transcription services that upload your files to remote servers, TaskScribe processes everything locally on your computer using advanced AI models.

### Core Value Proposition

1. **Privacy First**: In an era of data breaches and privacy concerns, TaskScribe ensures your sensitive recordings never leave your device. This is crucial for:
   - Legal professionals handling confidential depositions
   - Healthcare providers dealing with patient information (HIPAA/LGPD)
   - Corporate executives discussing sensitive business matters
   - Journalists protecting sources

2. **No Per-Minute Costs**: Unlike services that charge $0.10-$0.50 per minute, TaskScribe offers unlimited transcriptions with the Pro plan at a flat monthly rate.

3. **No Internet Required**: Once installed, transcription works completely offline.
